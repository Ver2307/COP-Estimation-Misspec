Published in: 'Estimation of the Dependence Parameter in Bivariate Archimedean
              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Plots the p-values obtained from a rank-based Goodness-of-Fit 
             test applied to moving windows of size 250 testing Frank,
             Gumbel, and  Clayton to be the adequate copula to model the
             dependence between series of AR-GJR-GARCH residuals from
             returns of DAX and DJ as well as from returns of Volkswagen
             and Thyssen-Krupp. The dependence parameter of the tested model 
             was estimated using Maximum Likelihood. The considered time
             span is 26.08.2005 to 13.08.2015.'
