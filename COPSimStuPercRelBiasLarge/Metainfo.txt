              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Plots the percentage relative bias of the estimates obtained for 
             the copula dependence parameter theta in a simulation study
             using ML, the inversion of Kendall's tau, and a p-value weighted
             average of the two in combination with the Frank, the Gumbel,
             and the Clayton copula. True copula is indicated by the title
             of each plot. Some estimates were obtained under  mis- 
             specification. The estimator is indicated by line colour
             and shape, the copula used in estimation is indicated by the
             fill colour of each shape.'

Keywords: 'Copula, Gumbel, Frank, Clayton, estimation, maximum-likelihood,

Output:  'Returns a plot of the percentage relative bias for each 
         estimator in combination with each copula as function of 
         the depencence level tau.'
