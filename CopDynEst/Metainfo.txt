              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Plots the dynamically estimated dependence parameter theta 
             over time. The dependence between series of AR-GJR-GARCH 
             residuals from returns of DAX and DJ as well as from returns of
             Volkswagen and Thyssen-Krupp was estimated using the Frank, the
             Gumbel and the Clayton copula in combination with maximum like-
             likelihood, the inversion of Kendall's tau and a p-value weighted
             average of the two. The considered time span is 26.08.2005 
             to 13.08.2015. The moving window is 250.'

Keywords: 'Copula, Gumbel, Frank, Clayton, maximum-likelihood,
