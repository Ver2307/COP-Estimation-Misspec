              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Plots the difference between the dynamically estimated estimated 
             for dependence parameter theta using maximum likelihood, the
             inversion of Kendall's tau and a p-value weighted average of the
             two in combination with the Frank, the Gumbel, and the Clayton
             copula for a series of AR-GJR-GARCH residuals from returns  of
             DAX and DJ as well as from returns of Volkswagen and Thyssen-Krupp.
             The considered time span is 26.08.2005 to 13.08.2015. The moving
             window is 250.'

Keywords: 'Copula, Gumbel, Frank, Clayton, estimation, maximum-likelihood,

Output:  'Returns two plots (as pdf files) of the 6 time series for each 
         of the two portfolios (DAX and  DJ, VW and TK) and a table of
         of summary statistics of the calculated differences.'
