Description: 'COPapp2residual shows pairwise scatter plots of based on
             AR(1)-GJR-GARCH(1,1) / AR(1)-GJR-GARCH(2,1) fitted residuals. 
             The upper triangular plots show the pairwise residuals
             scatter points. The lower  triangular plots show the scatter
             points computed from empirical cdf of the residuals. The 
             companies Volkswagen (VW) and Thyssen-Krupp (TK) as well as the 
             stock indices DAX and DJIA are contained.'

Output:      'COPapp2residual returns pairwise scatter plots from AR-GJR-GARCH 
             residuals (upper triangular) and from residuals mapped on unit 
             square by the empirical cdf (lower triangular), including DAX, 
             DJ, VW, and TK.'
