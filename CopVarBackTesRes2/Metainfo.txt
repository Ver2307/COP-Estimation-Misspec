              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Calculates the ratio of exceedances and the relative distance 
             between theoretical and empirical alpha for VaR estimates 
             obtained using the maximum likelihood estimator, the
             inversion of Kendall's tau and a p-value weighted average of the
             two in combination with the Frank, the Gumbel, and the Clayton
             copula for a series of AR-GJR-GARCH residuals from returns  of
             Volkswagen and Thyssen-Krupp. The considered time span is
             26.08.2005 to 13.08.2015. The moving window is 250.'

Output:  'Returns two tables: one contains the empirical alpha (exceedances
         ratio) and the other the relative distance between the empirical
         alpha and the theoretical alpha.'
