              Copula Models under Misspecification'

Description: 'Returns boxplots of the estimates obtained for the copula depen-
             dence parameter in a simulation study using ML, the inversion of 
             Kendall's tau and a p-value weighted average of the two estimates 
             in combination with the Gumbel and the Clayton copula. True copula 
             and size of simulated random sample are indicated by the title of 
             each plot. Distribution of estimates obtained using a misspecified 
             copula are illustrated by blue boxplots, those obtained with the
             the true copula are depicted by grey boxplots.'
